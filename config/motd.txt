You are on Biblio-32c, a snowy, barren planet that became a penial colony for the Imperium. Heretics and criminals were sent here, miscreants for whom death was too harsh but walking free was too lenient. With the way these things go, however, the grinding bureaucracy of the Administratum took its toll. Over the years, less and less supplies and orders came, and less the divide became between officer and prisoner. What began as a harsh prison colony became a backwater, ignorant world. 

Two months ago, a Rogue Trader came to Biblio. Although the people of Biblio barely remembered a time where they were under the rule of the Imperium of Man, the Trader had negotiated and bargained with those in the Adeptus Administratum that still cared. They wanted a world, a mining colony, for their own. When they came to Biblio-32c, they were surprised. Not only were there a large amount of mutants and abhumans, most of them weren't even aware they were Imperium citizens...and none of them seemed to be aware of the large amount of Warp on their world. An undiscovered gate, perhaps?

The Trader was intruiged. There were riches to be had here...and the danger was worth it. Even if the established nobility was mad about it, they were Imperium citizens, after all...
