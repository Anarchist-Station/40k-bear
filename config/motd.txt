You are on Biblio-32c, a planet that once bore rich fruit and beautiful cultures, until, seven years ago, the First Fleet invaded. Explosively. Within twelve hours, seventy percent of the planet's native flora and fauna had been killed. What chance did the natives have? They were fighting against particle cannons with swords and crossbows. 

Just as soon as the Conflict ended, the Fleet's ships descended from orbit and began setting up machines that swallowed up mountains whole and spit them out. This wasn't just strip-mining- it was raw, calculated efficiency. Millions more flora and fauna died from the rapidly dropping temperatures and the destruction of their habitat. The natives who survived were met with the threat of starvation or being forcibly conscripted by the Fleet. The planet was being sucked dry, despite what little resistance was still put up.

Three years passed, and the world continued. The natives of the planet were no longer just unfortunate realities- they had been conscripted into service in mines and military. However, just as quick as the Fleet arrived, it left, taking their huge mineral-extractors back into space with them as they sailed far away. Only a skeleton installation remained to control the entire planet- but the damage was done. Nobody had seen sunlight in years because of the layer of snow and ash in the sky. Almost all native species were dead, aside from the sentient races that were tenacious enough to survive.

The Fleet members unlucky enough to get put on planet-squatting duty had one advantage, at least- the native populace, generally, had not recovered. Though one organization remained, the House Nobility, it was full of weak, squabbling nobles that, surely, couldn't organize a revolution, right?

But something continues to stir. Underneath the surface...the old Gods of Biblio might still exist.
