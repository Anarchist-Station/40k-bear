It contributes to the Fleet's ability to keep moving forwards despite a lack of stable supply lines. Based off of the lost 'Eagle' design from the 2nd Fleet."

	desc = "The Shine, unlike its younger sibling, the Junker, is a proper military weapon. It was created from the start with quality in mind, rather than raw availability. It features a heavier frame and laser-crystal assembly that helps keep the beam focused and more accurate."

	desc = "A semi-auto civillian version of the F-50 weapons platform, Frontier Firearm's 'Hunter' is surprisingly deadly. Although it features the same receiver as the F-50 models, nearly everything else has been swapped out.
